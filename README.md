## Description
We created an app that displays the covid-19 numbers for every country. As the covid situation nears a year, people are itching to travel again. This app displays each country’s number of cases, number of dead, advisory status, and discussion posts from users. This app isn’t designed to encourage international travel. We discourage travel with warnings


## Installation
    `npm install`

## Usage
To run app locally:

    `npm start`

Once 'App listening on PORT: 3000' displays in your terminal, open your browser and search:

    `http://localhost:3000/`
